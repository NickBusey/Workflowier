Go to workflowy.com, click the Tampermonkey icon, then click 'Add new script'. Delete everything in the large text area and copy and paste the contents of script.js instead, hit save. Reload workflowy.com.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NickBusey/Workflowier/issues\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n### Current features\r\n\r\n - Adds a 'View Tags' button which opens a menu with a link to every hashtag in your document, with a count of how many times each tag appears.\r\n - Percentage complete of hashtags on mouse-over in the menu (in the title attribute)\r\n - Stores a list of hashtags ordered by frequency as last Node in Workflowy. That way you have access to a full tags list on Mobile Apps also. Generated on page load and every time you open the 'View Tags' menu. Working on auto-saving of this.\r\n - Add a 'Recent' menu with 'this week', 'today', and 'just now' buttons to show recently changed items.\r\n - Random hashtag functionality. Any hashtags with -rand at the end will go to another random item with the same hashtag. Basically recreates the functionality of flash cards.\r\n - Color coded hashtags ala painterly.\r\n\r\n  Example: #spanish-rand for spanish words you want to study. #capitals-rand for capitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Planned features\r\n\r\n - Items with 'due dates'\r\n - Potentially a calendar view for items with due dates\r\n - -randlist hash tag that just shows a random child. This may be more useful than having to put the -rand tags on each item you want to flash through.\r\n - Show percentage of hashtag items that are 'complete'.\r\n - Show streak of recently created items with hashtags that have been 'completed'. This will replicate \"don't break the chain\" functionality.\r\n - Better install/install directions?\r\n - Saved settings.\r\n - 'Always show completed items' setting toggle.\r\n - Random links colored differently.\r\n - Website with demo gifs\r\n - Filters for 'shared' and 'embedded'\r\n - Additional keyboard shortcuts\r\n - Individual list completion (Given one todo list with a certain hashtag, calculate and display the percentage complete of that list)\r\n - Generate charts of historical data (Given a hashtag with a data point eg: #chart-weight 150 it will chart the point over time )\r\n\r\n",
