That way you have access to a full tags list on Mobile Apps also. Generated on page load and every time you open the 'View Tags' menu. Working on auto-saving of this.\r\n - 'Recent' menu with 'this week', 'today', and 'just now' buttons to show recently changed items.\r\n - Random hashtag functionality.
