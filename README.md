# Workflowier
User Script for Workflowy.com that adds some extra features.

## Installation

Install Tampermonkey for Chrome. Go to workflowy.com, click the Tampermonkey icon, then click 'Add new script'. Copy and paste the contents of script.js in, hit save. Reload workflowy.com.

## Current features

 - Adds 1wk and 24hrs buttons to the header to show recently changed items.
 - Random hashtag functionality. Any hashtags with -rand at the end will go to another random item with the same hashtag. Basically recreates the functionality of flash cards.

  Example: #spanish-rand for spanish words you want to study. #capitals-rand for capitals.

## Planned features

 - Show percentage of items with a certain hashtag that are 'complete'.
 - A view of all tags on side of window, tag cloud. Ordered by frequency.
 - Show streak of recently created items with hashtags that have been 'completed'. This will replicate "don't break the chain" functionality.
 - Better install?
