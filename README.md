## Current features

 - Adds 1wk and 24hrs buttons to the header to show recently changed items.

## Planned features

 - Show percentage of items with a certain hashtag that are 'complete'.
 - A view of all tags on side of window, tag cloud. Ordered by frequency.
 - Show streak of recently created items with hashtags that have been 'completed'. This will replicate "don't break the chain" functionality.
